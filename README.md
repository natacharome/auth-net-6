# Authentication and Authorization Boilerplate



This is a .NET 6 authentication and authorization boilerplate to use in projects where auth is needed. 



## Routes

POST /api/Auth

POST /api/Auth/login

POST /api/Auth/refresh-token

GET /api/Auth/australia-cities (use to make sure role works)



## Improvements to make

- Create a role enum

- Add more infos for the user when creating account

- Check if password is long / complicated enough

- Change database
